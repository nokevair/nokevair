# Nokevair

Nokevair is an experiment in worldbuilding, or procedural generation, or emergent narrative, or artificial life, or something.

The ultimate goal is to simulate a single world with a complex history over the course of many decades. New mechanics and features are incorporated into the existing simulation without restarting it, and the full history of the world is always available as public record. You can sift through the thousands of interconnected stories to find one that interests you.

While the project is still in its fairly early stages, I intend to put a lot of attention into politics, diplomacy, and economics. I want there to be wars, conquest, intrigue, and revolutions. I want users to be able to debate politics and predict the fates of imaginary nations. I want epic heroism and personal drama to be realized in equal detail. Hopefully, this can be realized in some form.

## Publication

The driver will eventually be hosted on a dedicated website. However, simulation files will concealed, and world states will only be visible through the renderer.
